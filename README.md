# Let's host this app!

### Prerequisites:
- Have your front-end and backend on separate GitHub Repos (given you have a backend)
- We'll be using **Netlify** to host our react app! So consider signing up for an account first.
- If you have a backend, it will be easier if you host that first! We have a guide for that too ðŸ˜ƒ


### Process:

- Step 1:
  - Make sure all of your code has been pushed up. Preferably to `main` branch. Optional: You can also have a separate branch dedicated for just the **production**
  - Additionally, it'd be a good idea to verify that code on your branch works locally.
